# ATM Simulation System
Hey! This is a simple ATM program I built using Python. It's a fun way to practice object-oriented programming while simulating how a real ATM works.

## What can it do?
- 💰 Deposit money into your account
- 💵 Withdraw cash (it even shows you how many notes you'll get!)
- 📊 Check how much money you have
- 🔒 Handles transaction limits (just like a real ATM)
- 💸 Won't let you withdraw more than ₹20,000 at once
- 📝 Breaks down your cash into ₹500, ₹200, and ₹100 notes
- 
## How to use it
When you start the program, you'll see a simple menu. Just type the number for what you want to do:
- Type **1** to deposit money
- Type **2** to withdraw money  
- Type **3** to check your balance
- Type **0** when you're done

A few things to remember:
- You start with ₹10,000 in your account
- You can only do 3 transactions at a time
- Amounts must be in multiples of 100 (like real ATMs!)
- Maximum withdrawal is ₹20,000

## Quick example

Here's what it looks like when you deposite the money:
```
1. Deposit Money
2. Withdraw Money
3. Check Balance
0. Exit
Select an option:  1
Enter amount to deposit:  2000
✅ Deposit completed successfully
Cash Breakdown:
₹500 notes: 4
₹200 notes: 0
₹100 notes: 0
Current Balance: ₹ 12000

Would you like another transaction? (y/n):  y

## Why I made this

I wanted to practice Python and learn more about:
- How classes and objects work
- Taking user input and validating it
- Writing clean, organized code
- Building something that actually feels useful

Feel free to use this code, modify it, or learn from it. If you have suggestions, let me know!
